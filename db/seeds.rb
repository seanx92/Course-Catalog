# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

#records = JSON.parse(File.read('db/instructor.json'))
#records.each do |record|
#  a = Instructor.new
#  a.identity = record['id']
#  a.email = record['email']
#  a.first = record['first']
#  a.middle = record['middle']
#  a.last = record['last']
#  a.save
#end
